# Ingot for iBoss
A recreation of [Ingot from FogNetwork](https://github.com/FogNetwork/Ingot) that takes advantage of a new vulnerability found in the iBoss chrome extension.
Much like the original Ingot, Ingot for iBoss allows the user to disable force installed chrome extensions in their Chrome browser or on their Chrome OS device.
